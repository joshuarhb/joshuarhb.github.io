- **Contact Information**: How to reach me for opportunities or collaboration
- **Social Links**: Connect with me on various professional platforms

## Current Focus Areas

As I progress through my master's program, I'm particularly focused on:

- **Distributed Systems**: Understanding scalability and reliability patterns
- **Modern Web Development**: Staying current with frameworks and best practices
- **Software Architecture**: Learning to design maintainable, robust systems
- **Academic Research**: Exploring cutting-edge topics in software engineering

## What's Coming Next

I have plans to regularly update this site with:
